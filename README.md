There us some React/Redux stuff with drag'n'drop.
It's practice planer for yoga-teachers. I made it because I practice yoga and sometimes need such instrument.
Just drag'n'drop cards and build a sequence. You also could authorise and save your sequence to personal library.

## Languages and frameworks
### frontend
- javaScript
- React.js/Redux
- Material UI

### backend
- PHP
- MySQL

## Features
I decide to not use any drag'n'drop library and make it by myself. Becaude I didn't find d'n'd library with functionality that I searched for.
So it wasn't so easy especially for touch devices. I spend a lot of hours to make it works well. But now I know everything about mouse and touch events )

Have a good day guys, glad to see you here )
